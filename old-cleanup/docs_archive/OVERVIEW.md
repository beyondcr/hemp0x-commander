# Overview

Hemp0x App is a unified control surface for the Hemp0x network. It replaces the
legacy PowerShell GUI with a cross-platform desktop app that is fast, secure,
and easy to extend.

Primary sections:
- Create: asset creation, NFT tooling, and creative utilities.
- Commander: full daemon and wallet control (core feature set).
- Dev: pool/stratum tooling, deployment utilities, and diagnostics.

UX goals:
- Futuristic glass/slab aesthetic with a consistent, restrained color palette.
- Fast, responsive interactions with smooth transitions between sections.
- Clear security posture and live status indicators.

Platform targets:
- Windows 10/11 (primary).
- Linux (Ubuntu 24.04, Fedora/Nobara).
- Windows 7 is a stretch target and depends on WebView support.
